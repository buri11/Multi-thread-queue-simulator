# Multi-thread-queue-simulator
This is an application that could help large shops manage the queues at the cashiers, optimizing the wait times.

It simulates customers at a shopping facility and directs them to the queue that has the least amount of waiting time.

Moreover, this implementation is using threads, every queue having a seperate thread that it runs on.

The documentation is wirtten in Romanian, but can be translated at request.
